*** START ***
1. Linux terminal with gcc installed required.
2. Open terminal and navigate to directory with shell files.
3. Type "make" to run the makefile.
4. Type "./myshell" to execute the shell.
5. Type commands below to use supported internal commands.

*** SUPPORTED INTERNAL COMMANDS ***
cd <directory>: Change the current directory to <directory>.
clr: Clears the screen.
dir <directory>: List the contents of <directory>.  Leave <directory> blank to list current directory.
environ: Gives a list of current environment strings.
echo <string>: Displays <string> in terminal.
help: Displays this user manual in terminal.
pause: Pauses operation of the shell unter ENTER key is pressed.
quit: Quits the shell.

*** PROGRAM INVOCATION ***
Command line input is interpreted as program invocation. Each command creates a child process
that is executed after it is entered.  The parent process waits for the child to finish processing
the command before it resumes.

*** FILE-BASED COMMAND EXECUTION ***
To instead run the shell with a file with a set of command lines, type "./myshell batchfile".
This will iteratively run through all the commands found in the batch file, executing each
individually, one at a time. The command line for the shell will not be displayed using
this method.
